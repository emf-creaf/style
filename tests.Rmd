# Tests

## Organisation

The organisation of test files should match the organisation of `R/` files: if a function lives in `R/foofy.R`, then its tests should live in `tests/testthat/test-foofy.R`. 

Use `usethis::use_test()` to automatically create a file with the correct name.

The `context()` is not very important; a future version of testthat will display the file name instead of the context in output.

## Importance of tests

When developing a package tests must be implemented. There is no need of covering 100% of the code with tests,
but important functions and package workflows must be tested to ensure that they work properly and to be
aware of any regression caused by new code.
